	                    The purpose of this guild is to help you maximize your profits by guiding you step by step from getting started from scratch, to managing Take Profits, risk, leverage, and other essential factors. Our focus is not on giving a deep explanation of what cryptocurrencies are or the broader factors that influence their prices. Instead, we’ll keep everything 100% relevant to what truly matters: following our signals successfully and profitablly.

That said, we’ll begin with a brief introduction to ensure you have the right foundation before diving into the strategies.

	                    Each signal provides the entry zone, clearly defined take-profit (TP) targets, a stop-loss (SL) level, and additional details such as the recommended leverage. To ensure maximum accuracy and results, it’s essential to follow the entry zone instructions exactly as outlined in the strategy.

                    	How you manage your Take Profits (TPs) will depend on two key factors: the level of risk you’re willing to take and the capital available in your trading account. Based on these, you can apply different strategies to maximize results.
                	</p>

                	<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Strategy 1 – Risk level: Low</h3>

                    	In the long run, this strategy tends to be the most profitable, though it demands both time and patience. The approach is straightforward: open a single position targeting Take-Profit 1 (TP1), allocating just 10% of your total capital to the trade.

				    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-5">What is leverage?</h3>


				    <p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
				    	Imagine you want to buy a 100,000$ house, so you go to the bank to take out a loan.  The bank requires you to supply 20% of the value of the property as a down payment on the  loan. The result is that, for 20,000$, you can access a property valued in 100,000$. This is an  example of leverage in real estate. You have bought the house at a leverage of 5x (20,000 is 1/5  of 100,000).
                	</p>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		One year later, the real estate market has appreciated by 10%, so your house is now  valued 9 
                	</p>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		In 110,000$ and you decide to sell it. If you had not asked for a loan and you had paid for  the entire house from the beginning (100,000$), your profits of your initial investment would  effectively be 10% (10,000$). However, the fact that you only invested 20,000$ and used the  leverage, means that those 10,000$ of house appreciation no longer represent only 10% of your investment, but you will have made a much more profitable operation that will have given you  a return of 50% (10,000$ profits with an investment of 20,000$, which coincides with the result  of multiplying the theoretical profits-10% by your leverage-5x).
                	</p>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		Now, let’s apply this logic to a crypto trade. Imagine you buy BTC at 30,000$ with TP1 at  30,200$, and leverage is 10x. If you wouldn’t have had leverage and it hits TP1, the % profit you  take is (30,200/30,000)*100 = 0.66%. However, with leverage, you multiply that % by 10, so your  total profit when it hits TP1 is 6.66% of your initial amount. 
                	</p>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		Crypto trading requires a high amount of patience and discipline. You should not assess  your results the same day you start. Wait some weeks as you learn how to follow our  signals and manage your funds correctly.

                            Results are calculated just considering the Take Profit or Stop Loss level. It means they’re  indications, not considering a certain take profit strategy. We do it this way because not  every customer manages the take profits the same way

                            If your initial inversion is low, don’t assume huge risks to get bigger gains faster
                        </li>

                        <li class="flex items-center">

                            This is a mid/long-term game, so don’t expect to go from 100 do 1000$ in one week.  Instead, be disciplined and constant, and remember that your gains will compound little  by little
